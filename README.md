<b>HIMYM - themed Chrome Extension</b>

This extension is a How I Met Your Mother themed chrome extension (If I've breached any copyright by doing this, please go lightly on me, CBS lawyers). It takes all the text you visit and does the following:
-replaces the word "Legendary" with "Legen...waitforit...DARY
-Adds the word *salutes *to phrases where the words "General", "Major", or "Private" appear

I made this extension to practice my coding as well as create a little trinket for the HIMYM community in time for the end of the series. It's been quite the 9 year experience. 

This code heavily borrows from panicsteve's <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt">implementation of the Cloud to Butt extension</a>. 

This is the first Chrome extension and Github post I've done, so I'm still trying to figure things out. If there's any protocol that I'm breaching, please let me know. Furthermore, if you have any suggestions for how to improve this code, I would greatly appreciate it as well.
